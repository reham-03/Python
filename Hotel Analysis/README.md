Hotel Booking Analysis 

Problem Statement

The dataset lacked clear insights into booking trends, customer behavior, and payment patterns, making it difficult for hotel management to identify high-demand periods, popular room types, and customer preferences.

Solution

Using Python, I cleaned and analyzed the dataset to uncover hidden booking patterns, customer behaviors, and factors affecting booking status such as cancellations, no-shows, and meal preferences. Visualizations were created to simplify trend identification and support better decision-making.

Steps Performed
 • Imported and explored the dataset
 • Cleaned missing and duplicate data
 • Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA)
 • Created visualizations to analyze trends and distributions
 • Extracted actionable insights from booking behavior

Key Insights
 • Total Bookings: 5
 • Canceled Bookings: 2
 • Completed Bookings: 3
 • Average Stay Duration: 3.6 days
 • Most Popular Meal Type: BB (Bed & Breakfast)
 • Peak Booking Month: August (2 bookings)
 • Booking Growth: +100% increase in July, −50% decrease in September
 • Booking Status: Majority were “Check-Out”, with some canceled and others marked as “No-Show”

Tools Used
 • Python
 • Pandas
 • NumPy
 • Matplotlib
 • Jupyter Notebook

Files Included
 • Hotel Analysis.ipynb
 • dataset.csv

Conclusion

This analysis provided meaningful insights into hotel booking behavior, cancellation patterns, guest preferences, and seasonal trends. These insights can help hotels optimize resource allocation, improve marketing strategies, and enhance booking management.
