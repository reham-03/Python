Diwali Sales Analysis — Python Data Analysis

Problem Statement

The dataset lacked clear insights into sales trends, category-wise performance, and customer demographics during the Diwali season. This created challenges for retailers in predicting demand, planning inventory, identifying high-performing products, and understanding customer buying behavior.

Solution

Using Python, I cleaned and analyzed the dataset to uncover key sales patterns during the Diwali festival. Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations revealed important insights about customer demographics, product categories, and purchasing trends. These findings help retailers optimize inventory, forecast demand, and design targeted marketing strategies for festive seasons.

Steps Performed
 • Imported essential libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)
 • Loaded and explored the Diwali sales dataset
 • Cleaned data by handling missing values and fixing inconsistencies
 • Conducted EDA to study sales trends, category performance, and customer demographics
 • Created visualizations to analyze revenue distribution and consumer behavior
 • Derived meaningful business insights to support retail decision-making

Key Insights
 • Sales Trends:
Sales increased significantly during the days leading up to Diwali, showing strong festive-driven demand.
 • Category-wise Performance:
Electronics, clothing, and household items were top-performing categories, contributing the highest revenue.
 • Customer Demographics:
Most customers were young working professionals from urban areas, indicating higher purchasing power and festive spending behavior.
 • Regional Insights:
Sales were notably higher in regions with larger retail presence and strong promotional activity during Diwali.
